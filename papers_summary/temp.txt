Good afternoon sir!
I hope u're doing well.

Apologies for not updating you over the past three weeks. 
I wasn't well during the first two weeks of Feb, 
which hindered our progress. 
Under pressure to present some results over the next week, 
we explored workarounds and did literature survey
to set up an initial ML-based classification for network traffic. 
However, this took us some extra time.

Meanwhile, Sajal kept suggesting that we reach out to you when 
we were stuck, 
but I felt embarrassed since we hadnâ€™t made enough progress 
to present. 
Thankfully, last week, we finally managed to get started.

Currently, we have taken the PCAPs of classified traffic classes 
from the previously labeled institute dataset 
and converted them into flows. 
We then extracted time-series-related features such as 
mean packet lengths, mean inter-arrival time (IAT), 
standard deviation in these values, the flow sizes, 
flow durations, etc.

Using these features, we trained supervised ML models, 
including Random Forest (RF), RF with Grid Search, and XGBoost, 
achieving a maximum accuracy of 0.76 with RF. 
However, when we previously used CNN and Transformer models 
on the same dataset, we achieved over 90% accuracy. 
This lower accuracy suggests that our current feature set is 
insufficient for accurately classifying traffic classes.

We are now working on identifying additional features to 
enhance our dataset. 
We aim to present updated results to you by next week.
